""" The current version of the pytest-cgi plugin.

This project uses the Semantic Versioning scheme in conjunction with PEP 0440:

    <http://semver.org/>
    <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440>

Major releases introduce significant changes to the API, and backwards
compatibility is not guaranteed. Minor release are for new features and other
backwards-compatible changes to the API. Patch releases are for bug fixes and
internal code changes that do not affect the API. Development versions are
incomplete states of a release.

Version 0.x should be considered a development version with an unstable API,
and backwards compatibility is not guaranteed for minor releases.
